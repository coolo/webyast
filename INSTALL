REST-style access to YaST
-------------------------

rest-service implements a RESTful service to manage system resources
(e.g. user, network, services, updates, etc.)

It uses Ruby on Rails ActiveResource and D-BUS to access YaSTZ
functionality.

Prerequisites for running the rest-service:

- YaST
- PolicyKit
- ruby
- ruby-dbus
  (http://raa.ruby-lang.org/project/ruby-dbus/)
- ruby-rpam
  (See OpenSUSE factory for RPMs
  or 'rpam' below git://git.opensuse.org/projects/yast/rest-service.git)
- ruby-polkit
  (See OpenSUSE factory for RPMs
  or 'ruby-polkit' below git://git.opensuse.org/projects/yast/rest-service.git)


If you want to develop and test, it's highly recommended to install

- rubygem-relevance-rcov
  (For code coverage testing)
