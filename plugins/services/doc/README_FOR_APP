To configure Custom services, i.e. some application that is not handled by
/etc/init.d/ script but you want to manage it via this API:
   
 - edit /etc/webyast/custom_services.yml and place the info about your own service there

 - see the example file for custom_services.yml in this directory


To define list of services (both /etc/init.d and custom) that should be shown
in UI by webclient-services-ui, edit /etc/webyast/filter_services.yml.
