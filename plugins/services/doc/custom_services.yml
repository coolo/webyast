#	shortdescription: Short description of the service (one line summary)
#	start: path to application that should start the service
#	stop: path to application that should stop the service
#	status: path to application that should query the service status
#
#
# The file needs to be located under /etc/webyast/ or /etc/webyast/vendor/
# (the 'vendor' directory has higher priority).
# The file should be root only writable, because start, stop and status scripts
# defined here are called by root.
