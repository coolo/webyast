# Under 'services' write a list of services that should be shown in UI
# (in this order).
#
# As service names, use both standard services defined in /etc/init.d and
# the custom ones defined in /etc/webyast/custom_services.yml
#
# If the list is empty, all services will be shown.
#
# This file is installed as /etc/webyast/filter_services.yml,
# but higher priority has a file /etc/webyast/vendor/filter_services.yml.
# So to package vendor specific configuration, use /etc/webyast/vendor/
# subdirectory to avoid file conflicts.
services:
#  - cron
#  - my_own_service
#  - nfs
#  - cups
