<h2>Managing System Services</h2>
<p>
  The <span class="guimenu">System Services</span> WebYaST module allows you to manage
  system services available on the target system. To manage the system
  services, follow these steps:
</p>
<div class="procedure"><ol class="procedure" type="1">
    <li><p>
        A list of available system services is shown. Using the <span class="guimenu">Filter
          Services</span> drop-down menu, you can limit the list to show only
        the running, not running, dead, started on boot, or not started on boot
        services. Using the <span class="guimenu">Quick Search</span>, you can search
        services according to their names and descriptions.
      </p></li>
    <li>
      <p>
        For each service, a status icon, name and a short description are shown.
        You can expand the information shown by clicking the little triangle on
        the left. A longer description, detailed status information and
        <span class="guimenu">Start/Stop</span>, <span class="guimenu">Restart</span>, and
        <span class="guimenu">Start on Boot/Do Not Start on Boot</span> buttons are shown
        in the expanded view.
      </p>
      <p>
        To change both the current status and the on-boot status
        (enable or disable for the current runlevel) press
        <span class="guimenu">Start</span> or <span class="guimenu">Stop</span>
        button.
      </p>
      <p>
        To restart a service without changing its on-boot status,
        press <span class="guimenu">Restart</span>.
      </p>
      <p>
        To change only the on-boot status (enable or disable for
        the current runlevel) press <span class="guimenu">Start on Boot</span>
        orÂ <span class="guimenu">Do Not Start on Boot</span> button.
      </p>
      <p>
        The result of the requested status change
        is shown under the status buttons.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li><p>
        If you are finished, click <span class="guimenu">Back</span>.
      </p></li>
