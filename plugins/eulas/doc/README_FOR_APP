Eula
====

Plugin cares for licenses and serves them to web-client on demand.
It handles locale, order of the licenses, checks and sets whether licenses
were accepted.

Eula plugin package comes pre-configured with license for the distribution, 
which the package is built for.

Add vendor specific license
===========================

 - Store your license text into the directory:
     /usr/share/yastws/eulas/licenses/YOUR_LICENSE_NAME/license.txt
 - Add YOUR_LICENSE_NAME into /etc/webyast/eulas.yml configuration file.

 Optional
 --------

  - Store your license translations the same directory as license.txt and name 
    them like license.LANGUAGE_CODE.txt .
  - Your license can only be shown to the user (instead of explicitely making 
    him accept it). If you want to choose this behaviour, create an empty file 
    named "no-acceptance-needed" in the same directory as license.txt.
 
 Example of eulas.yml
 --------------------

 licenses:
   - SLE-11
   - YOUR_LICENSE_NAME

Accept license by hand
======================

To accept a license without using the UI or webservice API, create an empty file
 in the directory: /var/lib/yastws/eulas/accepted-licenses/LICENSE_NAME. Where 
LICENSE_NAME is a license name identical to the one in /etc/webservice/eulas.yml .
