EULAs
=====

 With the help of the WebYaST eulas module, users are presented with one or more end
 user licence agreements (EULAs) during the base system setup.

Configuration of EULAs
======================

 The list of EULAs to be used, in the order they are presented during the base system
 setup, is defined in the /etc/webyast/eulas.yml configuration file.
 
 Configuration file is started with the initial line:

   licenses:

 Then follows the  list of EULAs ordered as they should appear during the base system 
 setup follows. The format of eache line is:

    - EULA_name

 Where EULA_name is the name of the directory containing text of the EULA. The full
 path to this directory is:

   /usr/share/webyast/eulas/licenses/EULA_name/

 The EULA_name directory contains plain text files with the text of the EULA. Text
 files should be named using the license.locale.txt format. If the file with an
 appropriate locale is not found, license.txt is used as a fallback. 

 Minimum EULA configuration
 --------------------------

  Configuration with no EULAs is possible. When the file /etc/webyast/eulas.yml is
  missing (or if it contains only the initial line), no licenses will be displayed.

 Minimum single EULA configuration
 -------------------------

  Single license configuration MUST contain english text of the license stored in:

    /usr/share/webyast/eulas/licenses/EULA_name/license.txt

  and /etc/webyast/eulas.yml configuration file:

    licenses:
      - EULA_name

 Optional features
 -----------------

  If the file:

   /usr/share/webyast/eulas/licenses/EULA_name/no-acceptance-needed

  exists, there will be no Accept/Reject options displayed in the UI. After clicking
  Next, the license will be considered accepted.

 Translations
 ------------

  All files in /usr/share/webyast/eulas/licenses/EULA_name/ with the name 
  license.locale.txt are considered license translation files with 'locale' being 
  the language identification string. No other configuration of the translations 
  is needed.

 Accept license by hand
 ----------------------

  Sometimes, accepting the license from command line on the target appliance 
  is useful. Entering these commands:

    touch /var/lib/webyast/eulas/accepted-licenses/EULA_name
    chown webyast /var/lib/webyast/eulas/accepted-licenses/EULA_name

  has the same effect as accepting the license via the UI.

 YAML
 ----

 EULAs configuration file /etc/webyast/eulas.yml (as well as other WebYaST configuration 
 files) is written in YAML language. You can read more about it at www.yaml.org .
