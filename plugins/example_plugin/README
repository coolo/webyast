REST interface for accessing ntp configuration and synchronization


It uses own YaPI that uses sntp program. The reasons are:

- ntp-client is too much complex and cannot be easily extracted only required functionality
- need root permissions to run sntp and YaPI ensure also policyKit check

It uses only predefined ntp servers specified at /etc/sysconfi/network/config - key NETCONFIG_NTP_STATIC_SERVERS
