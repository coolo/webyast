<h2>Managing Software Repositories</h2>
<p>
  The <span class="guimenu">Software Repositories</span> WebYaST module allows you to manage
  software repositories. You can view the list of software repositories,
  edit them, or add new repositories.
</p>
<p>
  To view the list of software repositories, edit or delete them, follow
  these steps:
</p>
<div class="procedure"><ol class="procedure" type="1">
    <li><p>
        The list of available software repositories is shown. For each
        repository, its status icon, name and URL are shown. Using the
        <span class="guimenu">Filter repositories</span> drop-down menu, you can
        limit the list to enabled, disabled, or all repositories. You
        can also limit the repositories shown in the list by entering
        a string in <span class="guimenu">Quick Search</span>.
      </p></li>
    <li>
      <p>
        Click any repository in the list to view detailed information.
      </p>
      <p>
        Detailed view contains <span class="guimenu">Alias</span>, <span class="guimenu">Name</span>,
        and <span class="guimenu">URL</span> of the repository. The latter two fields are
        editable. The status of the repository and of its autorefresh are shown.
        Both can be enabled or disabled. You can also enable or disable keeping
        of downloaded packages.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li><p>
        To save the changes, click <span class="guimenu">Save</span>.
        To delete the selected repository, click <span class="guimenu">Delete</span>.
      </p></li>
  </ol></div>
