<h2>System Registration</h2>
<p>
  The <span class="guimenu">Registration</span> WebYaST module displays
  the registration status of your system and allows you to register it.
  To register the system:
</p>
<div class="procedure">
  <ol class="procedure" type="1">
    <li>
      <p>
        Log into the WebYaST interface of the target system and start the
        <span class="guimenu">Registration</span> module.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        You are asked for the <span class="guimenu">Mandatory information</span> the
        registration server needs. The needed information depends on the
        installed products. You will be asked repeatedly for any missing but
        needed information until it is supplied.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        More detailed information is shown under <span class="guimenu">Details</span>.
        Not all information sent to the registration server is shown here, usually
        only architecture, CPU type and timezone.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        Click <span class="guimenu">Save</span>.
      </p>
    </li>
  </ol>
</div>
