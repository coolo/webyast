== Network

  TODO link to a master API document that contains the common
  conventions like the authentication below.

  Only authenticated users are allowed to access the API. Authentication is done
  by sending a Basic HTTP Authorisation header.

  All names aren't allowed to contain spaces, slashes or colons.

  TODO how to document errors?

  <b>FIXME</b> for PUT requests the XmlBody and XmlResult documents are
  faked, they need to match the implementation.
