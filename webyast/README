Testing

Testing with the code coverage plugin (vendor/plugins/rails_rcov)
requires the 'rcov' gem. Install it with

  gem install relevance-rcov --source http://gems.github.com
  
(See http://github.com/relevance/rcov/tree/master for details)


Now run

  rake test:units:rcov
  or
  rake test:functionals:rcov
  
and have a look how good we're doing.

http://agilewebdevelopment.com/plugins/rails_rcov also explain the
various options for rails_rcov.
